                    I am currently a software engineer on the test automation team at Tandem Diabetes.
                    I am responsible for creating, revising, and updating scripts to test functionality
                    of the Tandem Insulin Pump. I develop in Javascript using the jasmine testing framework to create
                    scripts.

                    During my Junior year of college I did my internship with LabStats.
                    I worked at LabStats as a Software Quality Assurance Intern for three months. 
                    During my time at LabStats I helped in the creation of automated testing for the 
                    LabStats Portal web application. While creating these automated tests I was also in 
                    charge of greenlighting changes to the Portal web application before the changes 
                    were deployed to production.

                    For two years at Brigham Young University-Idaho I was a a Teacher's
                    Assistant for Web Development II. It was still a developing course
                    so I was able to assist in creating assignments. I also graded assignements,
                    projects and tutored students who needed help with projects or assignments 
                    throughout the week.
